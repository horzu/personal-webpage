            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am Mert! I am an Industrial Engineer and I have a M.Sc. in International Trade and Finance. 
            I have nearly 5 years of experience as Industrial Engineer (mostly planning and logistics) in automotive and fastening technologies sectors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the beginning of my childhood computers were the most interesting thing for me. I can still remember the exact feeling when I have my first atari and my computer!
            And I spent most of my childhood with playing those two. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I think commanding a non-living thing whether for fun or for a task is amazing. I love doing hard or repetetive boring tasks with programs. 
            With just a little bit adjustment, computers can solve our problems and do all the boring stuff for us. And also they can entertain us with games, videos and billion other stuff. 
            I think computers are the real angels god has given us :) That's briefly why I love them so much.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have become an Industrial Engineer because I love doing things more efficiently and doing a task in a shorter time. 
            But, as I said computers are also a passion for me. So, I want to learn computer science and be a developer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This webpage actually is the first step for me at my journey. It has been a while and I have learned a little in web development.
            I hope this site will grow larger with my projects and articles.
            </p>
